Currently freelancing for startups in the e-commerce and entertainment space.  Formerly helped launched and helped scale e-commerce health food startup from product concept to seven-figure run rate.  I've worked with a variety of technologies and love using JavaScript.  Recently I have been spending a lot of time building full stack web apps with Angular and Node but also have experince with Python/Django.
